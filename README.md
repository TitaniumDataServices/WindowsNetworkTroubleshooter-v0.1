# WindowsNetworkTroubleshooter-v0.1
Made in NORWAY

A troubleshooting tool for WINDOWS made in batch that makes it easy for you to troubleshoot problems with your network.

This tool is made to simplify your troubleshooting procedure if you ever experience issues with your network, because let’s be honest, we all experience network connectivity issues.
In most cases, the issues is actually with our computers, so I developed this tool to make the troubleshooting lot easier for people that might not be that good with computers, or for people that just cannot be bothered going through all of Windows’ different menus to find the right settings.

Before running this tool, I highly recommend that you unzip everything, since the tool might need to copy files to your computer, and/or create/edit log files for later use. Note that you will also need to run the application as administrator as some of the troubleshooting steps require administrator privileges. 

WARNING: DO NOT DELETE ANY OF THE FILES INCLUDED, AS SOME FILES ARE NEEDED FOR THE TOOL TO FUNCTION PROPPERLY! IF THESE FILES ARE DELETED, YOU WILL HAVE TO REDOWNLOAD THE TOOL IN ORDER FOR IT TO DO ITS JOB!

The tool comes in two different variations. One of the tools will work in standalone mode, meaning that the tools are built into the application. The Tools mode has all its tools in the tools folder. Upon startup, the tool will copy all these files to a folder in your C:\ directory. You can find this folder while the tool is still open, but the files will be deleted before closing the tool. 

If you ever experience problems with the tool, or you find other troubleshooting steps that has not yet been included in this tool, please contact me on my email. I highly appreciate every tip and bug you can send me.

One last disclaimer. This tool is only made for WINDOWS users, and it is meant to only troubleshoot and fix any eventual problems with the network on your Windows computer. If you didn’t get that – This tool is not for Mac or Linux. I’m still working on that. I currently have no estimate on when these are going to be released, or if they are going to be released at all.
